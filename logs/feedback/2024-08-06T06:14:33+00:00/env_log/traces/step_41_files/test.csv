C3C1D527011F,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. That could be a good opportunity for students if they finish school early they can be more independent, also can make more money a early age and build a magnificent future, another good thing it's they can buy whatever they want, and don't have to be necessary ask their parents for money also save money for their career at college.

At school we can see different kinds of age some guys are older that others, so maybe some students want to finish school a early time, If the students finish school early they can be more independent, and see how life goes life isn't easy and all of us one day will learn how to be more independent. Be independent it is a responsibility because you have to take care about something as; pay some bills, if you have car, well take care about the insurance, for some reason you live by yourself have to pay where do you live, and other responsibilities.

Second, make money a early age is a amazing thing to do because you will prepare for the future your goal is finish school, and maybe that would require extra effort like take courses during the summer, or work in the evenings to make up things that you need to do in another class, maybe that require extra work. At some point, you may not able to take elective courses but that decision is made by yourself, if your goal is finish school early you have to leave some things to get what you want. All dedication that you put, for sure you would have a recompense in the future, also don't have to worry for money because you are working hard for that.

Finish school early that can help you to be more successful like work for your own things, so if you need something you don't have ask a your parents for money; to get what you want, and another good thing is you can earn, save money for you career in college. A young age you are getting prepare to what's is next.

However, everyone choose what they want, some things would benefits your future and if you wanna make it work out in less time you can make it possible, there always another way to find out what you want, need, and to be a succeful person in the future. Build a great future would make your life easier.                "
C649BC3F0C2D,"A students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early is a bad idea, maybe have a lot of problem after they are finish high school for three years.

However, finish high school in three years is a good thing to think about it, students will move faraway and move on their life, but that are a small group of students who are thinking one way of their life after three years high school, but the other group of students are have a problem after they finish high school and they need help to resolve the problem they are in. For the students who are have problem need help to resolve, they problem are they making more decision that let they think about can the students do it or can the students sure about this decision or that decision, because is a big decision to change one person life and it happen to every students even the greatest student.

Three years students don't have enough time to think more about their future and not 100% sure about they really are in future, have a lot of students who are finish three years high school and have a good jobs or have a good place to live, not everyone the same life so some students before finish three years of high shool know what they are doing and after high school they making other decision. Four years students they are more ready for the decision and they are have more time to think about what and where they will be in their future, and they got all help from teacher and parent to help that think in mind steady.

Students are mostly don't finish high school three years they have less experiment about college then students who are three years high school, however the three years high school students have more problem then a four years high school students, three years high school students maybe on the time they thinking what they doing next if they can't make it or they are changes they carrer they end up stay with their parent forever into they know what to do next and on the time they off school the those student going to forget everything that they had learn in school and end up failing.

My opinions is every students need more time to think about their carrer in future, before step forward into their life they needs more time to think and do whatever they need in every class and think for their carrer."
C045A27AFE82,I agree to this beacase students like us always have to got to shcool evreyday of the week and somtimes students get stressed out beacause evreyday we have to got to shcool so it should be better if they extend the shcool time to shorter time or half way. In my opinion it hink that 3:15 is to much of our day so i think that we should make the shcool time shorter. I think it will be the best thing for evreybody because somtimes people have to do thing at home . Sometime si just to late to do them beacasue at 3:15 is already getting dark so i think it shuld be best for all of us if we should get out half time. It will better evreyone beacause evreyone will have time to doanytging that they have to do at home. The last thing i see is that other shcools get to get out more early that us and what i think is that is mot fair they come out early and we dont. But somtime we should have more time out of shcool because when i go home i have things to do.
EFD7D87EF4C9,"Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. Responsible and hard-worker people are the top choosen. Employers need to know that they can rely on this person in rough time. A trustworthy person who can help the team be better and cooperate positively.

No employer would hire someone who can't be at work in time, someone who always finds excuses to stay at home, someone who can't accept to be wrong.

I remember the way I was raised. My mother do not know how to read just because her parents were poor. In my country, Haiti, school is very expensive and not accessible for everyone. But, I had this opportunity because my mother made the impossible become possible. As she always said, '' Je me leve a l'aube du jour et m'endorme apres le couche du soleil pour que tu sois fiere de toi meme, et sois capable d'aider les gens comme moi. "" I graduated high school with advanced diploma. My mother died. She did not have the chance to see the fruit of her hard-work.

I want to make her pride from where she is. Because she was a hard-worker. She is my model. I have known how it felt to be miserable, dependent, be rejected, to count on someone, to fail again and again.

Even though I did not go to college, I am proud of myself. I can read, write, and speak not only one language but, 3 different ones.

I have learned to offer the better side of me in anything I am doing. I will not say I am the ""Albert Einstein'' of this generation but, I am intelligent , fast learner, humble and cooperative. I might not be the most experienced person for this work, but I am a good candiade."
34A066E69905,"There are two types of working. one of them is workinng with a group, another one is working individually. Although some people prefer to work alone. I belive it is so much better to work in a group. If we compare these two working types, the benefits of group work are more then those working alone.

Firstly, I prefer to work in a group because group work allow a person to work according to his or her strength, since the the group members apply their strong side to the work, the completion time will be faster. For instance, I was involve in a car desgin project several years ago. one person made engineering calculation to understand which parts are critical for our design, I made the drawings of the car components, and another friend of mine made the presentation for our project, then he present it to the teacher, He gave us a good respond and additional points since we completed our work before the due date. to be more precise, we did a great job, because we devided the work according to our strong sides.

Another reason why I prefer to work an a group is that I think that this type of work establishes a stonger relationship between the group members. As humans, sociallzation it important for us and working with a group give us a chance to improve our relationship. when people are in a group, they have to communicate with each other at each step of the process. for example, in our last year elective course, I made new friends becaude we were involved in a group project together. Thankds to the project, we did build a great relationship among each other, and we are still in touch.

lastly, group work improves the sense of responsibility. All group members are aware that their perperformance effects the group, so all group members try to do their best and work hard to get better results. For example, A few years ago, some of my friends and I participated in a competition which was related to optimization. since there was a lot of thing to do, we devide the topics among each other. we did not have enough information about one of the shared parts. however, a person who got that subject made a lot of effort to learn the topic well. He attended online course and read books related to that field. Eventualy, he accomplished it and did a great job. what I'm trying to say is that in a group work, even if a person does not have enought information related to his or her working area, he or she may learn things with his or her effort becuse he or she knows that a miskake will cause negative outcomes.

In conclusion, working with a gruop makes things more easier and helps make the group member work more happily. If we take the info account to all these factors, we may reach the conclousion that working in a group has more advantages than working alone."
D99C71A15BA0,"Society said that the first impression are almost imposible to change. But, I am totally disagree with that because there many people in this world that when they go to their first interview they don'tknow how to dress up for a interview and they may not have have someone to show or teach them how to act, how dress up or how important is to be on time when they have interviews or when they're going to meet someone important. It could be a girl or a boy that they're interesting on and their first impression may not be how his/her boss want it to be.

But if they're really interesting on that boy or girl who want the job or went to meet them they may give them a second chance to make their really good impression and that man/woman that like or want to obtain or to meet they will work really hard to get what they want ,they will search or obtain imformation on how to be presentable or to act in their interviews or when you're meeting someone you are interesting on. For example,If i want a job that is really flexible and easy and that's my first time getting a job and I am don't no nothing about how to be dress up, how to act infront of your future boss or future or girlfriend/boyfriend and how important is to be o time because it's how it works,If you're late to an interview or a place when you will going to meet with that girl/boy they will left or they may not interview you. However, If explain them what happend at the first date or interview that i wasn't presentable or on time they may gave me a second chance to do it and that's where I'm going to be at least 10 0r 20 minutes before on that interview or on that date that they gave me and be presentable and known how to act infront of them. They will like it and there you will gave them a second impression and they will gave you that job or you will have the chance to meet more that gir/boy that you like really bad. In conclusion,there is always a second chance to show or gave people a second impression that they may not believe that you can do it.

Finally, people can not judge people at the first time,they may gave them a second chance or explain them how to do it an that way they can be successful in life and they can make you happy if you get love each other."
DB621DB9A4C3,"Some people or business have adopted a four-day work week but everyday they will add two more hours and today our school want to try this model by extending the school day two hours after considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four-day school week. Now I want talk about this.

Although there are some people might say it's not have any different with the old model. It just add all of extending time together and people already used to the old model. We should not change to the new model. It's good if we cut one school day off and just add two hours for each day because you will have three day off , that's sounds great , we can do a lot of things if we have one day off. For examples you can hung out with your friends, go work out, because you already sit there for four days ,you need some sports. Usually 12th grad, they don't have any P.E class, they need to have some sports to make sure they are more health. Or you can just stay at home for study if you think school time is not enough for you, help your family do some work at home, like clean house or make some food for your family.

However people should have some change and progress for our life time , and make it become more and more good, perfect. Don's always keep the old way for your life, try some thing new. It will be fun. There are lot of first time you try already some not, for examples first time eat fish or some food that you never try before, first time go swimming or some sports that you never try before, life only have one time, and it's short , fast , don't make your life without color and fun. It will be boring, nobody want have that kind of life.

It's good for the teacher too, they are most tired people in the school, when they teaching, they can not sit there ,they need walk around and make sure you understand that the knowledge he just teach you. they need time for break too. so I suggest our school should change to this model, extending the school day two hours for four day.

0F7900292BB6,"Have you event been told that you had to chose a career before high school. I have, and I say we as young adult should pace ourselfs and not rush this important life decision so early. Because that decision de the person and the time, not important for take one career. Each young person has a decision to purse a career or not because it is optional.

First of all I disagree whit this idea, because young students are more like to listen what adults tell them to chose. That ends up on kinds chosen careers they dont want or like and in the long run it takes away their Dreams, money, and time. The kinds need more inspiration for that in future they take one career like: doctor, arquitec, teacher, and other carriers is good have one inspiration. Is good have persons that support in every time like Mom, family or dad. Because much young not listen the adult or not have support in the family for that reason they do not pursue a career.

Secondly us young adults need to expand our knowledge in the work field. Like for example we need to watch videos and have people already working their to explain How they work and ward they do. It would be a good idea to have two examples of people: a person who has ready finished his career and has work and money and the other, who does not finish his studies and asks for money in the street. Is good what a young thing in her future the difficult is life outside working in the hot or cold not is nathing essy.

Everybody have that thing in her future, on good future for the family, wife, sons, daughter. Is good have idea in the High school that like you. Because you like draw you take the career arquitec is good idea. The people inspired draw like building, the natural place everything is good. The people like arquitec to created building in Dubai is very nice I don't no but is beautiful in only imagination. Much person no have idea the important is the study in the life.

Much young take to abandon the high school and decision working because no everybody have east opportunity other people need more working because not have more family. I need one program or event for the people have one idea the good that is study. Study have for the benefit apprenticeship.    "
BFB07811C92D,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people think that they can control there first impressions at any time that they wanted to, but thats is not right, first impressions are so fast that it does not let you think, or express in a different way they are faster them a second, there are impressions that can be change, but it depends in the situation that you are in, and other can not be change no matter what you do. I agree with this statement, because impressions are an affect, feeling or image retained after an experience.

Some impressions had a really bat affect in our lives, less say there was a time were maybe the only impression that some had was really not the one he wanted, but was the only one he could do, for example let say that there is a student in a classroom, maybe he is not feeling good, and he fart that it makes a realy loud some, and that everyone in the class hear it, his first impression will be to act normal but he could not act normal, because he knows that it was so loud that everyone heard him, so his going to feel shame of him self, his face is going to get red, and his hears and but thats something you can not control.

The feeling that some get at the firs impression is almost like something you don't have every day, well if you have embarrassing moment every time them you may get the wired feeling every day. Went you get the firs impression and is not every day situation is almost all time shame, confusion, uncomfortable, some times pain. But when is a every day thing, them is almost all the time happynes, like the feeling I get went my family ask me embarrassing questions or we have embarrassing moments. Is almos all the time happiness. Because it is a very day thing that they ask me things that it makes me uncomfortable.

The experiences that people get went they have a lot of firs impressions, are so impressive that they can act normal in a lot of situation,

for example went they were use to act embarrass or shame now they are capable to act normal, because of the experience that they had. Like I personable had a lot of experience that now insted of feel shame or embarrass I only get happiness. like went my mom ask me if i had a girlfriend I only smile or answer her that i do not and it is all normal, or at school went my friends ask me if I'm dating the girl I like, the answer I give them is yes or not, like a normal student, I dont get shame or anything. Because I had some experience during my life that it make me feel normal now.

I hope that in the future one day, when someone ask me something embarrass, and make me get a moment when my first impression is shame, or embarrass my feeling don't show up, and my experiences take place, for it not to have more affect in the moment, and make it more embarrassing than what it is already, because I dont want it to make me lost my mine, and make the moment the worst one in my life.

1BAD681F72CB,"I think It will be enjoyable to couplet a science experiment because is an educational activity. You can have fun,you can work and meet with different persons,and you can learn more about the subject.

First of all I think It will be fun couplet a science experiment because I like sciences and I can learn more about experiment. Also I love going to my sciences class when we do experiments because It fun. I always laugh when I do experiment and they don't work. Another thing that I think sciences is fun is because you never know if the experiment will be work. One day me and my little cause we did smile in the kitchen and my mom gets mad and she make me clean the whole kitchen but, then we did smile in school and I already knew how to do it.

Secondly when you are doing a science experiment You always have to work in groups sometimes with your friend's sometimes not. For me its cool to work with different persons because when you do not know something and you ask them and they know they will help you and thats why for me is enjoyable to do sciences experiments because I'm a friendly person. One day in my sciences class we were doing an experiment then a new student came and the teacher ask me if I could help him and I said ''yes'' because he just knew Spanish and I help him and we became friend.

Then doing a sciences experiment it not just to have fun is to learn more about the subject that you are learning because is no the same doing the experiment then just listing to the teacher explaining. A lot of time this has happen to me that Im listing to the teacher but I don't understand nothing but when we do the experiment I do understand.

In conclusion for me completing a sciences experiment is one of the my favorite things because we don't just learn we have fun and thats why I like it. Also to complete a sciences experiment you do different things you don't just stay sit you move around. At the being of the year I did't speak to much English and it was hard to understand the teacher but when we start doing experiment it was more easy and now I understand more and that make me feel happy and that one of the reason I enjoy doing experiments."
E12401B92C3B,"Some people want to be the best example in life; however, not all of them can be. Even the most famous and intelligent people that we can know is not the best example to follow because if we go and investigate their life they also have done things wrong. Everyone makes mistakes and is alright in this world. I disagree with what Albert Schweitzer said. In fact my personal conduct is not the best way to act for other people to follow me because it is difficult being a good example and is better if we influence them differently.

To begin it is difficult being a good example. Everybody does good things in their life; however, there are some days where we do not feel good and by accident or because we want to do it, so we do things not right. For example: I do not like when my aunts talk to their daughters about me. My aunts explain them that I am a good example in my family because I have two jobs and I go to school and in my free time I prefer to stay with them at home than going out with friends that they do not know. I know the things they say are correts but I told them do not use me as an explample because now I am like that, but if tomorrow I decide to quit school or I do other things is not going to be the best example they are waiting for. Some might say that it is easer having jobs and going to school and being a good example in your family because there are many people who does the same, but I know in reality is very difficult mostly if you are helping your family too.

Next is better if we influence them differently. Not by being their examples but being as a guide to follow. For example: I have an aunt who had her first kid at her 14 years old. Now she is 30 years old and she does not have more babies just the firt one. She tells to my cousins and I that it was the worse experience that she has not for her child but for her husband. She remembers everything that she lived at that age and how she had to deal when she can not have her baby because she was young and her body was not completely develop. Later for her surprise she had to work and maintain her child and her husband because he did not work or do anything. Now she cries when she tell us her stories, but my aunt says that she wants the best for us and she does not want it to happen to us. My aunt says that she is not the best example in our family because she did not obbey my grandparents, but she has learned many good things in life base in her experiences. Some people may say that they are the best examples for their children even if they do things not right in the past, but I believe that we learn from those mistakes but still we are not the best example because we already did bad things.

In conclusion being an example of our own behabior is not the best way to influence people! There are many different ways to influence others as you know it is difficult being a good example and is better to influence people diferently. There are many occacions where we recognize that we do great jobs in life, and people have to see us like good examples. However; people can see us like good examples but not to exaggerate because some people think that just because they do something good they are the best. And I know they can think that because every single minute in our life is count it and also challenged, and we do not want to waste our time."
C6555F21F7CD,"I believe that Winston Churchill's quote,""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is true because after you make the mistake you learn how not to make that mistake again. The only way to learn how to be successful is to make a mistake. I think that you should always isten to your elders because they have been threw rough and happy days. When we are little, we always think that our parents are being really strict, but they're only trying to keep us happy.

I have made alot of mistakes when I was a pre-teen and I still make mistakes now,but at the end i realize that I was wrong. I was thirteen when I got my first phone and my parents always told me to not have social media till i'm sixteen. The only reason why my parents said,""no"", to social media was because they didn't want me to get hacked by people. All though, my parents said no to socail media i got it anyways. After couple weeks of having social media, someone decided to hack my snapchat. At that point, I realized my parents were always right.

My parents have made mistakes before too. When I waa a baby, my parents took me to my grandparents house for the first time. After we got to my grandparents home, my parents forgot to close the door behind us. So, I crawled out of the house and they didnt see me. After that, this guy saw me crawling down the streets and there were cars driving by me. So, the guy carried me to his shop to see if anyone comes to find me. After couple minutes, my mom realized I wasnt there so she ran out of the house to find me and than couple blocks down she saw in someones shop. My parents always checked if the door was closed after that incident.

Always keep in mind that you shouldnt do anything without thinking of the affects. If you not sure if its right or wrong, then you should ask someone for their opinion. If that doesn't work out than your probably doing something wrong. If you do something wrong then people will change the way they look at you. It better to keep in mind that your family and friends have faith in you.                                                      "
3E1A0BAC4372,"Sometimes knowledge is very helpful but sometimes imagination could be helpful to.

When I was seven years old I imagined many things but they never happened. When I turned 13 years old things changed and they were not the same as I imagined before. I thought that I was gonna acomplish those imaginations in my head but they never did. One day I noticed that imaginations were not better than knowledge.

One day my mom and I were suffering because we couldn't get to the other side of the river and we decided to build a boat to get to the other side and we made it. The knowledge we used was unexpected because we never thought we were gonna make it to the other side. Knowledge is very helpful when you are struggling with something but you also use imagination because you think before building or making something.

I believe that imagination could be important sometimes but knowledge is more helpful and we use it very often. Imagination could change things but not better than knowledge. We might always think that imagination is better I agree with you but if you think of how easy it would be use knwoledge while you are struggling than you would understand the differences.

Knowledge is very helpful in many ways and very often. I disagree with the prompt saying that imagination is better than knowledge. Always try something first and if it doesn't work try using something else. You will always find the solution on something different just like I did with my mom. Always think of something that you can use to solve a problem."

EB0F373C1D2A,"Summer breaks in most countries are 45-60 days long. Students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. From students' point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. However, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school.

Furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you've learned. One might say, ""well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies."" But to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. We all want to lay low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisifying sound of waves.

What is the solution? Put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. It gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. For instance, if I'm studying History of US Museums, I can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. Student can't get everything done on weekends so they need more time. Teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7-day break and ask them for their progression. Moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one's character. The summer break, however, is still there but shrinked to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long.

All in all, 7-day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion; while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies. "
F160E7B1FD96,"In the future first thing i would really like to do is graduate from high school with good grades and also making it to a great collage. I would really like to go to collage to study about how to be a lawyer but before i can make it to collage, it's very important for me to make sure i'm doing good in school and also making sure my grades are good, i am hoping to graduate high school with being top of my classes. I want to show people that with trying your hardest, you can sussed in life. I would be the first in my family to make it to collage. I want to make my parents proud. something i also enjoy doing is helping people out. Me being a lawyer means i can help people out with problems might they have with the state law.

2. Before my dream can come true, i have to work hard. I have to make sure I am doing all my school work, making sure i get to school on time. also something thats very important is keeping your life profile clean. staying out of trouble is very important, something collages well look at is grades and your background life. a collage wouldn't want someone who has bad grades, someone who is always getting into trouble or someone who just doesn't care bout anything. They look for people who are trying their hardest to be someone in life. going to collage means you want to try hardest so you can be someone in life. collages teach you everything on what you want to be. they help you make your dreams come true.

3. Something i'm also looking forward is to learn on how people do their job. i want to learn how they speak up for the person who they are helping out, how do they know what to say, is it scary? i have so much questions t ask. my goal is to be someone who can help people out, who everyone comes for when they need help. i would like to make people happy but right now my goals are to make sure i finish school. i have to work hard to keep my grades good and also make sure i stay out of trouble.

738112C600B8,"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be.

When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you don't know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you don't really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens. when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are.

Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out you'r pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. Second a house you're impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the you start realizing that the house was making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before making fun of them of talk about them because everyone in this world isnt perfect and everything has a story behind it.

7FF600C1F829,"There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. In today's societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them.

Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Of a young child, it's dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. By the time the young child gets older, it's interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore.

Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesn't mean it's healthy for a young teenager. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesn't have any and stays at home playing video games. That's why some parents disagree with today's societies. The reason why is because, they don't like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future.

However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion.

Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact it's maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed.

It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career.

As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about. Those were my ."
0AFC8CE27321,"By the time students enter high school, I believe that they should have an idea of what type of career they would like to pursue after they graduate. For some students, committing to a specific career at young age sometimes is a good idea as long as you have a backup idea for a different career in case you decide that you do not want to pursue in that career anymore, thats why committing to a career at a young age is only sometimes a good idea because you'll never come up with another career if you keep changing your mind. The courses that you study in high school should be thought about as well because maybe you need a specific degree from a course in order to pursue in that career.

I believe that, if a student is going to commit to a career that they should be very passionate about this career, they should be at least a junior in high school so that they've had time to get a feel of the other careers and decide which one they enjoy and suits them the best, and they should keep in mind the requirements that are needed, the benefits, and the types of jobs that it offers to them. Students who commit to a career at a young age are usually athletes, or they plan on working in their family business.

Pursuing your career needs a lot of hard work in school especially in this generation because you're going to need to go to a good college so you need a good GPA because you're going to want to go to the college that has a good academic program for the career that you plan on pursuing. Therefore, you need to go to college, and work hard so you can get a good job because most jobs, don't hire anyone without a college degree.

Finally, thats what I think about choosing the right career for yourself, and committing to a career at a young age. although some may still believe differently and disagree with my view on this issue.                        "
9392E2E0AA1E,"I agree with the writing ""

Determine never to be idle

"" buy Thomas Jefferson. I agree with this writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something. the second reason that I agree is that I think we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. Lastly but not less I think that inactivity also can serve a purpose.

The firs reason that I agree with Thomas Jefferson writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing some thing. What I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to say was that if we help others we wold be doing a lot for others. For example if we see someone that is tring to cross the street and they cant do it by them self because of a bad weather or because that person has a disability you should help that person because belive it or not you would make that person day. I also belive that Thomas Jefferson writing stans out for those people that dont have a home or a family y that can suport them if you can try to make that person day better by getting them a some water or food. I also belive by bing nice to people you could make there day better because you dont know if that peson had a bad day at work or something bad hapen.

Seconly I agree with THomas Jefferson writing because we can accomplish more if we are always doing some thing. For exampel if you are tring to pass a class or a SOL try your best and no matter how much you fell get up and get up stronger and keep tring. I think it also meen that is that if you are working and you dont know how to do it ask for help like that the next time you do it you can do it better. I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to tell us not to givre up.

Lastly but not less I belive that inactivity also can serve a purpose. Inactivity also can serve a purpose because if some one is provoking you and you jump up and keep it going then there can be some problems. For example if you are at work and some one provoke you and you reack to the provoke you could lose your job. If you get in troble because some one you and you keep the problem going it can afect you later on when you going to get a new job because they going to see that you cant control your self. Thats why i think if you go an talk to your boss when some one is causing you problems is better if you react an you lose your job for not contlroling your self.

In conclution I think we should help any one that needs the help and not just think that they would be fine because we dont konw what they been throug and we would like for some one to help us when we are in troble or when we are not dong well.    "
23B40A807A4E,"It is wonderful to accomplish something that you really want by working hard you can get it, and when you have already accomplish that goal or dream you fell so great that you did it. ""Like my mom always said to me that in this life you have to work hard to get what you want.""

First of all,

My mom work cleaning houses she work hard to give my sister and I the things that we want, and she always have a goal to work by her self and have her own cleaning jod. Not working with a company that they make her work hard and pay her little money, when my mom came to his country [U.S.A] she start working for a women that women put her to do alot of house and pay her little money and when my mom told her that she was giving her alot of work she was angry at my mom. My mom then she start workin give another women that do the same thing they do twelve houses everyday my mom was so tired and not only that there was another women taht was working there that she hate my mom all the time they have problems. My mom don't want that anymore and now my mom have her own job she one or two hause everyday and in a week she make five or eight hundrent dollars she have work hard to get want she wants.

secondly, My parents want to buy a house to have our own house and that renting a aparment that is so small that a house and have our own space. My sister and I we were sharing the same room and we always have problems because she always have leave trush in the room she didn't pit it up I always have to do it and I was tired of that. Living in a aparment you don't have a space to plant flowers or playing around with your cousins. My parent they always were going to the bank to take up a loan but they couldn't beause they didn't have a good interentest and they continue to go to the banks and woking hard to have good interentest in the bank and fine they get it. My parent buy a hause and we have like six or seven mounth that we are living in that house.

Also, I have a friend that she study hard to have good grades and a counselor from the school call her that want to talk to her that she can calify to a university for having good grades. She went have to go for a mounth to stay in that university to know how is live of the university and compete with other students, then that same counselor take her to Generic_City for a fiel trip to go and see some people that will sing in a famouse place. She have work hard to get that things that she have get.

Accomplishing same thing that you really want a great thing beause you can have a better future and have a great life. Sometimes is hard and challenge you said I cannot to these anymore but you can do it but you have to work little hard to get there. Sometimes it is very challengeful for some people but they break that barrier that stop them to continue but they do it why other people can we are the same. "
5F88187C25B8,"It has been said that positive attitude is the key to have a succesful in life.

I'm agree with the statement about the importance to have a positive attitude in life, because that's one point at favor that can helps us for work hard everyday and give the best that we can do and had a success in everything we can make and do in life. However, depend on people,how much they want have success in their life and if they're a positive people for work hard and have what they want in their life and give a better life to their next generation.

Success in life is not just to talk about the everything is going to be easy for us,but it the depend how the people think and how much they want to have succesful life,somethings you're going to feel the everythings is hard and not the way the you think but you keep faighting because you have one reason why you work that hard for give to their family a better economic and education, when we talk about a better economic and education we're talking about to proper a better future for ours sons and daugheters for one day they can have everything and don't be worry about to work for have money for collage or university that one reason why people have a positive attitude and want to have a succesful in their life.

Positive attitude, Change they way of people think, for example my father is man who don't have a good education but he has a positive attitude and the way he works hard for give to my family the best he can take is super wonderful, because he is showing me the when you want something you have to work super hard and put on your mind the you can do anything you want and depend if you like to do it, he is always tell me a goods advice and giving me a big lesson the i have to learn in life for have a better future.

Another point the affect so much today in day is the way the people think ,depend so much how you look the things and think about it if you can really make or some people they fast get desolution when something do not work for they and the way they wanna, but everything depend how that person works and how much love him or her put for get a good result, but thats not the end of everything, people have many change and tryies in life, is something doesn't work for you have to let go and look for another change and you need to have in your mind a positive attitude the you can make or do doesn't matter how many times you try for get that job the you like or the car the you wish with all your haerth of the house of dream, everuthing depend how hard you work and how much you faight how have the things the you wish to have in your life and everything have a one reason why you work hard in your life.

In my conclusion have a positive attitude is very important for have a succesful life and that helps people to have a vision why and why you work hard everyday of their life and show the importance the you need to have it and the controls of your mind and the power of make or do what you want to have in your life. doesn't matter how hard was for get there but one day you're gonna see and say i make all these when you finally are there you going to see the everything hads one reason why you do all those stuff and you're gonna be happy and thats one thing of many reason why we need to have a positive attitude in our life."
F610B3CBF3DF,"Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", Meaning success can only be achieved by having few mistakes along the way. Many believe achieving success means doing everything perfect and not making one single mistake, having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful because one can learn from the mistakes that are made and helps improve to achieve something better.

To be successful, there will be some mistakes in the journey but when those mistakes are made learning from them is the best way to accomplish your goal. For example, when one is constructing a house but have little knowledge on construction, the one building the house will mess up and fail at times but the best way to finish something is to learn from what went wrong. To clarify, to accomplish a certain goal, learning from the mistakes along the journey is the best way to do it. Not only learning from mistakes help be successful but it also helps improve one another.

Improvement is a big key in success. Failure will always have a role in success but it happens to help improve to become or do something better. For example, famous altheles in sports make mistakes in games all the time, but from the failures in the past, pro altheles train to improve more to become better and to not make the same mistakes again. In other words, failure may be the worse but it's a way to show what to improve. From mistakes made in the past one will become better or do better than expected.

Having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful. Failure will play an important role during the journey of success but you learn from mistakes and improve to be better, success isn't perfect, the little mistakes along the way are actually the things that make one get to the top and become successful."
7B802407D629,"We choose our own character traits. One character trait is kindness, someone who is very kind and friendly to everyone. my second character trait is rudeness, this is someone is usually not nice to others. My third and final character trait is helpfulness, someone who is always looking to help others. I chose all of these character traits, as i felt these are all traits that people choose themselves.

The act of kindness is someone who is very kind and friendly, its one of many character traits. A lot of people choose to have this as their character traits, and most have it for a good reason. It should be said that people are not born kind, they choose their own traits that fits them best. Some choose to be kind after seeing how some people can act so different towards other people, or their parents just simply raised them to be kind. This character trait is a very common character trait, and i hope more people is it in the future.

Rudeness is a somewhat uncommon character trait used by a small number of people. Not everyone is going to be a good person, some are rude all of the time for no apparent reason. A lot of people are rude because they are most likely going through something, or thats just the trait they had growing up. I know a lot of rude people, teachers and students, most are rude just because thats the trait they decided to choose. My final thoughts on rudeness is that not everyone is rude, but theres always gonna be that small amount of rude people in the world.

The helpfulness trait is of my most favorite traits. Helpfulness is when someone who is always looking to help someone in need, and also make sure they get the help they deserve. I am a helpful person myself, i try to help people with their problems if i can. A person who is helpful is like that as they have always been like that, and just want to help anyone in need. The world is a much better place with helpful people, i hope they don't go anywhere.

My counter claim is that our character is actually formed by influences beyond our control, and that we learn from these influences what our trait really is. I say this is false, we are supposed to choose our character traits, and they are what makes us who we are.

We choose our own character traits. One example of a character trait is the act of kindness, a person who is friendly to all the people that comes their way. A second example of a character trait is rudeness, these types of people are generally rude to everyone that comes their way. A third example of a character trait is helpfulness, a person who wants to help others in any way. I have chosen these character traits as they are the most commonly used character traits."
D49547B9FCB3,"A lesson that i would share would be that some thing the would befinfit there lives like how to be good in school,because if you wanna be someone in life you have to go to school and get your education. because most job look your grades in school and a diploma and if you wanna go to college you can get soclerships. And how to get good grades is to turn all your work in to the teachers and dont turn it late because that takes your points off and you dont want that and if you dont turn it in that will bring your grade down by a lot until it is a zero and you diffidently dont want that and how not to get in trouble is when a teacher ask you do something do it because they are to only going to tell you once only then after that is in school suspension and you dont want that because it is boring and it goes in to your record well i dont that or you dont want that ether so just what your are asks and DONT talk back to a teacher the rude and not nice .that the lesson that wanted to give you.

BEFA85A6134B,"Have you ever come across of asking people for an advice if so great. Asking people for an advice is a good way to see what is good and bad. Why cause if you do something stupid your going to regret it. The good part is that it's gonna be for something that your gonna get better at. If so lets say your having a hard time baking a cake and you ask for someones help. The person you ask for help might say "" Don't bake that cake for to long and use less eggs"". So in that case you learn from the mistake and now you know how to bake a cake.

First of all it's great for asking an advice cause you can ether learn from it. When something wrong your friends are there to tell you what to do or what no to do. Cause if you dont ask people for there option it can mess you up. Let's say your about to fight someone without no one concern. If you would of ask for an advice they would of told you ""Dont fight fighting is not the way to go just stay with me you'll be fine"".

Asking for an advice is the way to go less getting in trouble.

Secondly advises can take you far in life you might say how it's just words, but each words have meaning. You remembering what people tell you in situation. Remembering the words they told you and you wont be in that same situation cause you learn from your last mistake. The word that can take you far in like is ""Tell me who you your hanging around with, i'll tell you who yo really are"". That sentence is strong cause it keeps you thing what your doing with your friends and what have you been do. Just ask for an advice to no get in trouble and be a great person in the world.

Lastly advises are great way to show that you care about someone cause not everyone is there for each other. Other might not care your going threw tough time, but ask people for an advice to not to anything stupid or something your gonna regret in the future. Another thing try to asking other people for an advice cause two is better then one. Remember don't do something stupid there are people around you that want to help you in your goods and bad. Lastly be smart of what your gonna do its not gonna hurt you if you talk to someone and get an advice from an old person.

In conclusion, asking people for an advice is great cause it can help you in situation. Such as good and bad there are always time your gonna need to talk to someone. Always ask for help never stay quite cause cause your gonna do something your gonna regret. How I hope I showed you what is good for asking an advice and the pros and cons."
DF74545A44C8,"The great artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

This is mena that people setitng their direction to high they falling quick, but they setting their direction too low that achieve their mark.

For my opinion, people set their aim as high as they can, because they know that if they set too low; they won't have that power to finish or to get it. This made people thought their aim is high; they need to work harder not just the 100 precent they need to put more than 100 precent into it and get thieir aim. Not all the people can reach as high as they set, but at least they try eventhought they fall they still on a good postion. For example, I have a quze total points is 100 and I try to get the full points, but in the end I only get 85, it's still good, because I know my aim is high, I need to do hard. When people set their aim too low, they won't have that power to finish it, because you know that it's easy to get it, and you don't even have to prepare or try for it. This make you don't know what you really want and need. It will let you just stuck there. From my opinion, I really agree Michelagelo's satement ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

In my conclusion, people should set their aim as high as they can, eventhought they cannot reach it, but at least they try it, but don't set a easy aim that you don't even have to try your best to get it, this will not improve yourself. "
37193A72B5D2,"Teachers and some adults think that some students are expected and have the capacity to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Student are the only ones who can decide If they are able to take care of that responsibility or not.

In my opinion I think different and I don't think that young students are able to carry out with a career and a will support my reasons. First of all I think about all of that students who are already independent by their self, they probably have a job and need to pay their own bills, the rent, their phone, and they maybe have no time to carry out with all of that responsibilities with their education and the career at the same time, they need to work hard study and that is not easy for them. As the same time they probably have a lot of homework to do and they need to be responsible at their job. Another good reason I have is that some students without time they have no help, and they have no support from other people to try and see if they are able or they are already capacity to care about the career in high school, many students are able to do it but some of them are not able to pay for the help or the stuff need for the classes, some students have the luck to find people who just want to help them, and give them the opportunities to go on and help them with the decision they take to carry out with the career in high school but teacher or other people just don't want to help them just because they think and the give their opinion that they are not ready to take that decision and they still learning and have not the capacity to work on it and they just leave them and the don't give the students the opportunity to explain or show them that they are able to do it. Also a lot of students are fighting and giving all of they can with their education and they are giving up, they get tired with all the classes they have with all the responsibilities they are carry on and that why is hard for them keep studding in high school but must of the student are strong and still working to getting prepare even if they are having problems at their house or problems with their family they just wanna move on. Even though that some of students are too young in high school and they are still learning about how life is, how hard is to take care about the responsibilities the adults are already taking on and they think how hard can be if they take the decision to identify a career by the time they enter in high school it can be difficult to them because with the rest of the courses the are taking they will take more then normal classes. For some reason the students are not even thinking about their career when they are just enter the high school they are probably focus in the responsibilities they are going to have or they are already have in high school with their education, they have to take care of them. A lot of student make a mistakes, for example when they doesn't care about their education and they focus on being the best in their personality how many friends can they have or how good can they look, they need to ripen on their attitude and star thinking about their education they need to think how good in their education can be better on or how good grades can they have to make their family proud or how far can they go if the keep working hard and make proud of their self.

People can think that it would be easy for them or some of they can think that it will not. I think that it is not a good idea selected to guide them toward a specific career, thats why I just explain my reasons so they can see that it will be difficult, hard and stressful, they are too young and they can't take care of a big responsibility."
623B7BD7613C,"If you have heard of the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, then maybe you would have remembered that he once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" and if you don't agree with his statement on individuality; here is why you should. You should have the freedom to make choices for yourself and have independence of action and thought.

Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the communities's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.

But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or person's authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of you're friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

Inclusion you should be yourself and think for yourself and aggregate the qualities and characteristics that distinguish one from others and have the assertion of one's own will and personality."
5CB186BF742C,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others, but the use of the technology had cause negative effects on people's lives because, people spend time on video games, people became antisocial, and it is less helpful.

First of all,

people became addictive playing video games, and they spend to much time on it. Video games take you out of contact with others. With the use of technology daily affect people's vision, with the time people use glasses.

Secondly, people became antisocial with the use of technology because, people prefer to spend their time on the internet than having a conversations with their friends. People use to have communication with others by the technology instead of hangout or doing any activities with them. The majority of the people prefer to shop online, and lost their time thinking if the clothes is going to fit them, instead of go to the store, try the clothes on and see if is a good idea to spend the money.

Finally, the use of the technology is less helpful and have a negative effect on people's lives because, the technology take people out from the real world, for example if people shop online and they have questions they have to wait to long to get their answers, but if they were at the store a worker would help them. The use of the technology affect the communication with other people.

In conclusion, technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others and it can be faster; however, the use of the technology affects people's lives, and the communication between two o more person. In my opinion people should use less technology, and enjoy conversations with their friends and family."
C8620D9D22DC,"I think by having older students with younger students would be helpful. Because older students can help the younger students with homework,projects and classwork. Older students how to do the right things that can help the younger students.

To begin with, having older students can teach the younger students on what they need help with in school. This can be really helpful to younger students because with help someone that is older then you they can help you improve in school. Like for example my friend is one year older then me and helps me with school work when I need it. Older students can help teachers by help the students with classwork. Having older students in a program can be useful because they can show the younger students how to act the right way in class,and show others to do what they need to do.

Additionally, younger students can look up to older students that they trust. Because they have helped them in school and having fun spending time with each other. Some younger students might think an older student can treat them as a sibling. Like for example I see one of my friends as a sibling because we have been friends since we where little and I trust them. So it's good to look up to some one that you trust and count on and be their for you when you need them.

Finally , I think having older students and younger students in the same program would be great. Because older students can show the younger students how to be right and do what your teacher tells you what to do. And parents want their kid to do good in school so they can have a good life to live. Having a mix of older and younger students can learn to do things together. By having older students it can effect the younger students to do good in school.

In conclusion, I think it's good to have a mix of older and younger students to be in the same program. This can help older and younger students to work together. And helping one in other is to help improve what they need help on. Like on homework,classwork,and projects to see what the need to improve."

For example taking your own path is like concurring the world. enjoying what life brings and challenges to succeed Ur journey . you can be taught to be strong , no fear ever given fearless and a strong independent person. life can bring you so many surprises and you will fight and get what you truly deserve.

Taking your own path not seeking for guidance is a really important thing to do and accomplish. Its a wonderful thing its like doing the impossible ; never thought life choices crazy things that will change Ur life for the best . At the end of the road just no u did the impossible life changing,spectacular,amazing choice. Everybody will doubt you hate you tell you that you cannot do it that you wont last; but when you do it just no u achieved the impossible.

You can get where you hallways wanted to be.

There for i believe that taking Ur own way and doing it alone and succeeding it is the best way to Ur journey.     "
2F7B0CE01B4B,"People who take decisions with guidance from experts and authorities have a higher chance of making a correct decision then others, although many prefer going with his or her own instinct or idea. Seeking guidance helps to see from a different perspective, which could allow for a better choice to be made. At some point and time we all need advice from someone who is experience or would like to know what is there perspective of another person, even though may think that they need to make decisions themselves without anyone's advice or opinion.

Taking decisions is a tough thing to do in general, but seeking guidance from experts and authorities can help you make this decision with less frustration or confusion. For example, we seek advice on a daily base from our teachers, following our parents foot steps, but we rely on our own thoughts, we listen to our elder closely because they have more experience. People who lose sight of seeking guidance usually end up making a wrong or bad decision. Most people tend not to think about the cause of what made this decision come back or the effect it can have on others. As for, Someone who seeks guidance it is likely that they have gone through the same situation or something like your situation and can help you make a decision that can help you but also consider the effect it may have on others. As a result, with the advice of someone whom is more experience can bring a positive outcome.

Decisions are made on a daily bases from when people get up to when they go to sleep. For example, If someone has to take a decision some may fall into pressure and that led to take a decision that may not be the best and can have a negative outcome. When asking someone with experience there can be various ways or choices given to or ways to approve the situation. They can also give feedback on a decision someone was planning to take that could work out but also, could have been something that effected the person who was making the decision. As a result, If the person who was making the decision had not gone to get feedback or advice the choice of the decision could have been a decision that made to another decision allowing the decision process to be repeated and stay with a negative effect until that person has asked for advice from someone with experience.

People who make their own decision get ready for life guidance could help in difficult times, although they think that It Is smart just going with the idea or instinct they have it is also a good thing to ask for someone opinion or advice. Because, they may not being seeing the bigger picture or maybe they are not seeing the pro's and con's or the decision they are going to take. Asking for advice is also another way to assure that what you are going to do Is right. Therefore, whenever taking a decision it is best to ask someone for advice because it is likely they have gone through the same thing that someone is going through. "
8295FC2CA419,"Aiming too low and falling short isn't the best way to be successful.

Being confident in what you're doing is great but what if you're too confident ? Not everyone has the same definition of success; Your vision of success might be their way of seeing failure. By setting your goals low, you're taking the potential risk of not attending the necessary capacities expected from you.

When aims are set high, you are also sure to achieve your marks, have the pride of succeeding and be confident in what you're doing, this affects your mood too, therefore you are happy in how well you are doing, have the desire too do even better.

The science fair is coming up this month; Doing a project on volcanoes sounds like a good idea, you're familiar with the subject and have done it before, teachers love projects that demonstrate real life actions, all though; This idea is unoriginal and five other students are thinking the same way as you are, by doing the volcano project, you would be aiming low, you must get out of your comfort zone in order to achieve your goals. Choosing another subject for your scientific project without being boring and using a real life causes would impress the judges, give them useful information without being too specific.

By setting your aim too high you are taking a risk and could possibly fall short, but by aiming low you are closing the opportunities of going bigger and doing something you wouldn't normally do that could lead to potential Utopian future of yours.     "

.To conserve energy and resources, my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours. because everyone get tired or estreced, do not make enought money to buy resources, and dont have enougt time to be with the family.

The beneficts to conserve energy is to sleep the eight hours. so you can conserve the energy and don't be extreced about be more time in school. In contrast if you do not sleep well you feel like you will felt sleep. so is better less hours of school because eveyone will conserve enegy and the less hours of school can bemore better because everyone would be consentrated and learn more.

Is hard to be in school and have a job after school. because both of them are important for our life. but must people what need is money. so must people prefer to work and make money than have more hours of school. for this reason many people prefer to have money because can buy any resources or enyting that they need.

for example. If I am working and also going to school and the school day extend for two hours. I feel very extreced, so many peolple cuit school. And prefer to work.

There are also some disadvantages because if they extend the school day two hours is not inought time to be togeteher with the family.

everyone need time to have and be with the family because family is importan. so for these reason my chool should not fallow this model. if you spend more time in a job or in school there is not enought time for the family and olso everyone need time to make the differents responsabiliies that have.

for these reasons my school should not follow this model because many people get extreced or cuit school. so they can conserve anergy and resources and have have enought time with the family. and the hours of school everyone can be more consetrated and don't felt sleep and learn the possible."
EE855A723FE0,"First of all Hello, Ms. In my opinion I think that is better to work in group. I have 3 reasons that I would like to share with you my reasons are that everyone would like to share differents ideas, Also working in group we can finish more early, and we can socialized with different people. Now I'm going to describe you why I choose this reasons. By sharing ideas I meant that everyone can have the opportunity to think and talk about that that person think. Because we don't have the same's idea's as other people thought. After all people in the group share their ideas we can writte in a piece of paper and see which one's are good and makes any sence, about the topic we are talking and we see which one's we can put on the class work we are going to do. Also about that we can finish more early, we can show it to the teacher on time and she can give as her opinion and ask her for some help about what part she think that we can add more especific words or meanings. Because sometimes we think that we have a good project but sometimes we have to figure out what part we can change and put differents things. And the last but not least that we socialized with other's this one is my favorite because in this one I can discribe a little bit of my self when I just came to this country from another I was so shy because no one came to talk to me in my second day of school. In my English class my teacher make a groups and some people start talking with me 2 person from that class help me in my english because it wasn't that good. I was so scare because first everyone was looking to me like I had something in my face and in this country everything is different to my country in this one we need some friends that help us when we need some help in english.

Them I introduce my self to everyone and I start making new friends. When we are new we think that no one is going to talk with us because we are from another country. Sometimes they don't talk with us because we don't speak the same lenguage as other. But we have to try our best to be friendly and make that the person doesn't feel shy we would like to that person feel happy in school and in each classes. Tha's why I think that is good to be working in group not alone. When we have homework or projects we like to have some help then doing by our self that is more hard, the projects are always so difficult or sometimes you don't understand what the teacher said because we are seatting on the back and some students are talking and we could't hear anything about what the teacher is talking about. But in a group they are 2 or more then 2 in the same group is good that one of that person of your group understand and explain to the people didn't get it. The internet is a big problem to alot of us some of us that we don't have internet or computer eather. I think that is a problem for me and one of the reasons that I like working in groups some family doesn't have enough money to put internet in home or buy a computer in home but also go to a public places that have internet and computer we have to pay. But working in group one of the students may have internet and go to that person home. I know that in our school we have computers in the library but on weekends is close the school or some of us we can't stay after school. Because we have to pick our littler brother or sister from other school. But the good thing is that one of us could have computer or internet in home and research some things about our work or project. Another thing that is good working in group is that when we are explaining a project in from in class we don't feel ready because we have to talk a lot or others reasons but in groups we can break parts and each one is going to talk about that part she or he loves more.

My Final opinion that I would like to share is that working is group is a good option then working by our self. Because not all of us have the opotunity to have internet, not all of us speak english some of us we need that someone speak our language for example sometimes I need someone that help me with some words in english that I don't understand because my first language is spanish and it's hard came to a country that don't speak your native language. And we can know new people to talk, not with the sameones because there is a lot of people that we don't talk and they are in the same classes of us we just want to be with the same ones and have to talk with everyone and help then when they need help.

Sincerely,

B0B703E881B7,"I think we should have phones in school only when we have free time on our own and when we are in class we should finish our assignment first and that's when we should have phones out. Including our music we would like to here it only when we are taking a test or we are doing an assignment quite and that you wont bother any people. If we abandoned the phones they would still not follow direction so why even try to abandoned them, that's why I say we should allow the school to have phones out in there free time and if they catch us with the phones they should not take them away. They should just say can you please put your phone away."
B4B2CB4AA07F,"The School Board plans to add one and a half hours to school each day. Is that a good or bad idea?

I disagree with that because, many students have other activities after school. It could also affect the teachers by them staying after longer and kids would just have to take in a lot of new material including homework and its not healthy for them.

I feel like when they add extra school hours to the day it would mess the students schedule up, they could have sports after school or tutoring. They could really enjoy their activities and for them not to be able to do any of that anymore does not seem fair.""I have soccer practice every day after school and I love it and it would be a shame if i had to give it up because of more school.""The parents would also have to change their schedule because they could be at work and then have to leave to pick up their children, they would also not have as much time hanging out with friends or family because school would be their main focus when they could be outside being kids. However students enjoy seeing their friends at school and saying ""hello or hi"" we need more time to communicate as well so our friendships don't fade.

Teachers as well would have to work longer shifts, and they already stay after grading students papers while they also have to find out what the next lesson is going to be the next day. They take time out of their day to help the students who are falling behind in the subject and need a little more help to make sure they succeed in school and in their future. Teachers also have families just like every other person in the world, which means they should be able to go home at a good time and help their children out with their work or be able to cook dinner and take time out to care for their kids. Teachers need breaks as well they work very hard to maintain the material we need to understand. They leave the school late like 5-6 and when they leave they look exhausted just imagine them leaving at 7-8 including the fact that they sometimes would stay after helping students and that makes the student tired. We need to give teachers some credit and not push the limits for them as well.

Students stay at school for eight hours each day and if you extend it to nine and a half hours that does not seem like a good amount for students. If they get a lot of work on top of their homework that could stress them out, and because of that their grades could go down because of to much work. We only get three months from school and some shorts breaks and then we have nine months of school, and then you add another hour then what is the point of a break when you just make the school days longer. Kids love going outside and doing there hobbies they can't just sit in a chair all day that also just makes them more irritated. Students also have test's and quizzes including homework each week. If you add more hours kids are probably going to fall asleep and not pay attention which would lead to not participating, students would not have a good attitude either because they would be grumpy and upset that the school day is longer. Our brain can only take so much and they would over due it which is not good for our health. We sleep 9-12 hours a day and have another eight hours at school and then we come home and do more school work and study which leads us pretty much with two hours of they day for us to eat and get ready for bed, just so we can do it over again the next day.

As a student I feel like that would be to much. We are people not robots we need to live not be stuck in a building all day long. We have family and friends that we want to spend time with and that won't be able to happen if they change it because,"" they think we need longer days."" Yes we need our education and we will get it, but for now we only live once so need to make it count and focus on the present."

AB834A70D155,"Technology allows us people to complete many task without having contact with others. People can check out book ,shop ,and play games without speaking another person. Limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on people lives here is why without technology we are nothing because we depend on the technology everyday,every second of our life.

Technology has negative effect on our life here is why .In school the teacher goes over present ion online and it does not teach the student how to do there assignment . Because of the technology there is no teacher and student connection. In my country when i was young we did not had any technology my teacher would go over the assignment and he would explain the assignment on the board and if you did not get it .He would explained it to you again thats what school should be about making a connection with the teachers. I remember when i was young me and my friends would hangout in the cafeteria we would talk about our day. But now because of the technology during lunch time all my friend just uses there phone and we dont even talk to each other. Because Limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on on peoples life.

Because of the technology we have war between country with nuclear weapon. Because of technology people do not go outside of there house. They stay home and watches movies,read book and play games cause they have the technology to do that. they don't care what happen outside even if some is dying outsides of there house the would not care because of technology makes human emotion less and makes us weaker. We depend on technology way to much. when i was young if need a book i would go to the library and get the book rather than being lazy and sit on the couch and order it online technology makes us lazy. I remember we would go to eat food out and enjoy each other company talk to each other. Nowadays people just order food online and eat inside and use there phone rather than talking to each other. There is no more human connection.

In work technology is helpful but you are always get distracted because of the technology. Human being are easy to manipulate if there is game going on and there favorite team is playing. They will forget about the work. pull there phone out and watch the game. Because of that they get fried from work than they have to find a new job and figure out how to get food. If you did not had technology we would not had that problem. The technology is making people losses there job. Sometime technology can be hurtful then being useful.

Because of technology there is more accident than there were when there was no technology. Because people when they drive they text each other and they miss a turn and get hit by a car accident happen. Because of your mistake there is another person dead and you are blame for it. cause of you somebody loose a husband,wife ,child in the accident.

In conclusion technology has negative effect on human life. Technology makes people less human and lazy and weaker,

useless also there is no more human connection because of the technology. without technology we would be cave man because defend on technology to much."
9D716D9F4EBA,"Education meals are important to students' ;having a meal given of our choice will help us improve obstacles that we phases everyday. A meal contains:the main course, a side of vegetable or fruit,and a drink of our choice. Given a healthier meal we will be productive in school,and our everyday life. Eating a healthier meal will reduce the chances of being obitisty. A lack of a bad food would result the chances of not getting enough knowledge,compare to having a healthy meal. The school cafeteria should serve a healthy meal.

Students look forward eating lunch during school,because lunch refuels the mind,and the body with important victims. Lunch is the second important meal of the day,because students look toward a short break during school to refill their body,and mind. Eating a healthy meal in the middle of day will help students pay attention during school. Junk food is bad to serve during lunch, because it won't allow the students to be more active during the day,and pay attention in class. Overall students need a healthy meal to go on with there life during school,and outside school.

Throughout the years the chances of being obesity has increased. One of the main reasons why is because school lunches has served unhealty food. Junk food is unhealthy for the human body,because getting enough food will make you gain weight. Calories are based on what you eat,eating unhealthy will make you gain weight while eating healthy will help you balance out calories. Eating healthy will help reduce the chances of being obesity.

Eating a health meal during school will make the students be productive during school. Biting into an apple is the same thing, as drinking a sip of coffee. If we don't serve healthy food the chances of being active in school will decreases. If we serve our students unhealthy food than they will be lazy throughout the day. Giving the students a healthy meal will make them be more productive.

Therefor serving your students a health meal for lunch will help them accomplish obstacles in school. Serving your students will help them improve of being smart. Knowing that if you serve your students healthy options on what to eat they will not be obese. Productive is based on what we eat. If you serve unhealthy food you the chances of being smart,being fit,and active in school will decrease.        "
6B370155C425,"I think reading would be a enjoyable educational activity because you might find a book very intresting to you and it will also help your brain better at reading. reading is fun and also educational but it all depends on the person because some people might not like reading they could like reading when they are adults. and the best thing about reading you can do it anywhere like at school,friends house,airport ext. some people are into alot of different genre's like comedy,or horror,drama,ext. i like reading diary of a wimpy kid,and comic's my favorite was diary of a wimpy kid dog days it was about a kid named greg getting his first dog and not knowing how hard it is to take care of it.

if you don't like reading alone their are some things called bookclubs if you don't know what they are they are a group of people friends,family ext and they read the same book as you and talk about it they tell predictions,summarys, if you are wondering where the bookclubs could be located in librarys or you can make your own wiyh your friends or family. and this is what i thinks is a enjoyable educational activity."
A80542F83A7C,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. It would help the students who had a bad experience at school. Students who are in their comfort zone will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students that are at home will most likely be distracted, and will not finish their agenda. Some students will have a hard time teaching their selves. Also it would not give the students, the chance of experiencing what it is like in school.

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction.

Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies.

Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. By having that comfortless and being in your zone of learning, will highly benefit you to show your potential. Being in the right environment also help students focused. Students who is really serious about being successful and have that high standards are more likely to be successful. Family can also motivate them, to keep on pushing even though it might be hard for them but having your family by your side can really motivate you to keep on pushing.

Therefore, i really believed that, students should really have the option to take online classes or video conferencing. by just having that it would benefit lots of student, who are having problems being socialize to other students or teachers. it would help the students who had a bad experience in school. And it also would benefit the students who are in their comfort zone, and being able to focused and having that chance would increase the chances of more students will be successful."
AC5D4FAD6FDA,"Imagine a classroom fill with students using their cellphones. What do you think they are really using their cellphones for? Some students do not really use their cellphones for educational purposes but use it as an excuse to wonder off and get distracted with it. Students should not be granted permission by any teacher to use their cellphones in class, it is a mistake.

A major distraction now a days is social media. Instagram,Snapchat, and Youtube have impacted the lastest generations. When teacher allow their student to use their phones most of them at times just login into instagram or snapchat. It can easily be proven by the amount of students that come after class and tell their teacher they could not complete their classwork. Social media can be a weapon in and out of school , it will distract students from their work.

Social media isn't the only distraction a student can have from completing class work. I've notice that student at my high school download these new games on their cellphones. When a teacher of mine tells us to pull out our cellphones to do some research, I see more than half the class flip their phones and start to play this new game called Fortnite. This game is very addictive that those students who decided to play when asked to do research, their grades dropped straight down to a failing grade. This is why allowing students to use their cellphones can be a mistake,they are failing their courses.

Texting you're friends during class is the last distraction for a student. Students during class might've been waiting for so long to text their freinds back. Most of the times it's really not more of a ""hey"" or ""how are you doing?"". Students really have long conversations and get carried along that they forget what they were asked to use their cellphones for. High schoolers are always just on their phones texting one another and wait until last minute or the last day a assignment is due. Texting can be the worst distraction for students and this is why they should not be allowed to use cellphones for ""educational purposes"".

In conclusion, schools should prohibit teacher granting permission to student to use cellphones during class. Cellphones can be distracted and it will allow many students to fail courses or not complete asssignments. Students spend more time on social media , games , and texting their friends more than doing homesworks or even reading a book.          "
F7E78C064324,"When people ask for advice they most talk about how to do play sport or do they do they homework . Or they talk about people will explain how to do you homework like a teacher she/he can teach you how do to the work.

What people as for advice like what If that person was new to the school and ask a lot of people you should help him.,

You can explain how can help lot of people who is new to the school, Someone can explain how to better at sport and can tech you how to get better. Someone can explain lot of tings of talk about that class or he/she can stay after school for a better grade or to fix a test that he/ she do bad at the test.

35954693FE8E,"High school, the most perfect time to plan for the future. In some societies, students are required to identify a career by the time they enter high school. The high school will select courses for students to guide them toward the career they are considering. Some people say that it is not a good idea to identify career at high school because students are not ready for entering the adult world. While other people say that it is a good idea because it helps students to plan for their future. To me, I believe that knowing what am I going to do is important. Once people have their goals, they can plan and prepare for their futures.

How can people plan for their futures? By thinking about the careers they want to enter, they might also think about what are the things they like to do. They could choose the careers that are the most interesting to them and the perfect colleges base upon their interests. Also, people can have more time to work on their dream such as search more information, meet basic requirements, and get advises from their counselor. Therefore, when people are ready to go to the college, they won't be confusing about what to do. Because they have their goals with them.

What about prepare for the future? Well, some schools will provide courses that will fit to students the most. If the students identified their careers, they could do better at studying the related objects in college than those who haven't think about that thing at all. Because the students know what they want to be, they can choose to take related courses to learn the knowledge they might use in college courses for their career. Some people can even save thousands of money just by taking AP courses which will give them the credits that college will accept.

Some may argue that it is too early for students to think about their future by the time they enter high school. They have plenty of times to do that during their senior year. However, if students don't know what are they going to do after high school, they will have no idea about which college is the best for them and what career they want to have. By considering and taking the courses in high school, people could get to know the career and decide whether or not they want this career. It is better to change your mind in high school than in college. Because by that time, people will waste their money and time to change their majors.

Anyway, identifying your career when you are entering high school is a really good idea. You can choose the courses that are perfect for you and your career and also be ready for college since you have your goal already. Therefore, high school is a perfect time to think about the future. It is the entry to the adult world. So don't just doing nothing but waiting for someone else to help you to decide, after all, we have to choose our own futures right?"
15AC952FFBC1,"Have you ever wanted an advice, but you ask more than one person. By listen different advice or opinion you have to ask more than one person. When people want an advice they ask more than 1 person because they want to hear different advice to make sure they don't make mistakes, and they want to hear the right an advice.

I think people should ask for an advice to more than one person, because maybe the first person that they ask for an advice were wrong. For example, when I need an advice I always ask my parents first. I always ask both of them, but sometimes they always have different opinions, parents always have the right advice for you, but the problem is the sometimes they both give you a different advice. Sometimes they told you an advice that you might not like, or the one that you weren't not looking for, and thats when I ask other people about advice like my teachers, friends, brothers, cousins, principals. just to hear what you wanted to hear or the right decision.

Without a doubt, I would ask more than one person for and advice, to hear about others people situations. clearly, I would ask multiple people an advice because you never know who's wrong or who's right, but atleast people give you different opinios, so they're giving you ideas about what you can't or can do. On the other hand if you ask only one person for an advice that person might be wrong, and you might to a wrong decison.

People should listen to all the advice that people give to them. I always listen to all the advice even if they're wrong i just need to make sure not to make the wrong decision. Sometimes I make mistakes by not listen to the right people.

People ask more than one person because when the first person that you ask and they told you something different, what you really wanted to hear. For example, I personally like to ask my parents for an advice first, but sometimes I don't like what they say to me, so thats when I ask other people like my friends, sometimes you think your friends are right not your parents. But let me tell you something parents are always right it doesn't matter if you don' like them or whatever but they're always right they will never will give you the wrong advice.

I can make the right or wrong decisions because i'm a human and everone had make wrong decision in their life. But sometimes people give you the wrong decision. When I ask for an advice to multiple people, you have to make the right decison. Those people might be right or wrong. I think that asking more than one person for an advice is right because you never know who's right or who's wrong."
E34E1B7D1691,"""I want to be a singer!"", is what I told everyone, at 8 years old, I wanted to become someday. As I kept getting older, I started exploring more career opportunities that I could achieve someday and my interest started to grow. With high school and the programs and opportunities that they give us, It is tough to choose between the one I want the most. I wouldn't want to risk any of my hard work into a career that I would end up disliking. With that being said it would be a huge honor if I you could give me the opportunity to visit and get to know about the work that interest me.

While many students at my age have already decided what career they want, I am not sure enough to make a decision yet. However, I know that this program will help me decide what is best for me in the future, by learning the skills and requirements to the career I may be interested in. This program would help me sign up for events, classes or even trips to the road of my success.

In fact, even by talking to someone with the career I am interested in would help my knowledge. Also, it would help me narrow down between which career I would most likely succeed in.

The dedication there would have to be behind getting to where I belong to with your help, wouldn't be a problem at all. With the skills I have already learned with being in high school, I would already know how to manage my time with my career and real life. Your help wouldn't go to waste but would lead me in the right direction to my future. On the other hand, this career might persuade me to become an artist and not to have given up on that dream I once had. I am pretty sure that if you and of course, myself see an improvement in getting involved with music, and having a huge passion, you could help other dreamers like me in the future. Most importantly, by helping them find the right path for them.

Once the choice has been made and there has been improvement with the work I have put in and also being sure with what career I want in my future, I would gain more passion and inspiration. This would help me to push until I have accomplished everything I have worked for. I couldn't of made it without this program though, this company could help me a lot if you give me the chance to show you that it would be guiding me in the right path. With the opportunities you give, that not everyone sees, I may become one the greatest artist in this generation.

I am hoping you really consider the motivation I have behind this, to do whatever it takes to explore my options out in this world.

With that being said, It would be an honor to have the opportunity to explore the options in my career with your help. By leading me in the right path, and by not doing something I am not sure about and letting that go to waste. I would be able to develop the skills you guide me in and also by keeping me on track. The road this company would lead me in would help me become successful. May you please give me the opportunity to suceed? I would love to have your help by keeping me on track to my future.               "

Introduction:

We can see to simple nudes ayes when some people have the high enthusiams and we can detected if a person are sad, happy, when you talking or with yours expressions to the other people. The people who have enthusiams are the persons who ever have more people in the around whos can help them, so if they see a person sad, they go where him and they try to be happy him again or they asked you how they can help that person, but a person who doesn't have enthusiams they worry about to other people.

People who have enthusiams:

They can to do all whatever they wants, because they are happy.

They can create a grat ideas when they are happy in that moment.

They can help to other person who need help.

They can to be the best in everything.

They can to be happy to ther people who are tired or sad.

People who doesn't have enthusiams:

How you can help to other person if you doesn't have your own enthusiams.

If your enthusiams is bad, don't be alone.

If you don't have enthusiams, you doesn't wants to do anything.

Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success?

No, I'm not agree whith him because, if we failure and failure everytime again, so we enthusiams go to down, but if we failure just one time and the next time we are more preparate, is almost same that happen to me the day nobvemver 19, 2018,

that for see the hour from my phone, some people think that I did cheat in the SOL, but I doesn't need do that for pass this SOL.

Conclusion:

The bad enthusiams not just affect one person, that affect to the people who are in the around because if we can transmit cheerfulness to the other person and the other size the coin, other people can transmit the bad enthusiams I think so, so the person who have a good enthusiams they try to help to the other people. Winston Churchill with that he said, I understand that thing; That person whos failure and failure, are the person more strong because each failure they return more strongers and they do the best job.

DF785B00E2A2,"I think to working in group will be more beneficial for me, Some reason the

I prefer to work in a group is becouse will can share ideas and opinions that way will be get better grade, Another examples will be, every one in the group will found diferent information and that way we can pick the better information before to proceeding to writng and finich the work.

And another hand my central opinion to work in group will give you the best beneficial because if one of the student get sick the other student can continued to work, that way we can not stop working. And alway work together will supported the idea with the specific information,

Another importan examples is if you working in group you can asked to you group for help, you can shere the work, either one in the group can provide the better ideas and following information in order,

that way all together we can planned the work before writing.

Athoner reason for work in group in my personal opinion is feel more beneficial because you not work alone, that way is less stresfull for each student because every one share the work.

And some time for one reason one of the student has a emergency and the position the best option is work in group because will be more beneficial for each student and the way all the rest of the group can countinued wokt.

and still whole group will be get same grade, however they work together in the group.

In conclusion working with a group is the best, in my personal opinion, I prefer to work in group because the way I improve my work,

working in group is the better way to work because we has many benefits like share ideas, imformation, etc,

and the end I hope you prefer aech student has to keeping work in group.

Thank you.                                                                                                                                   "
95540EBC3FC9,"With the development of education, every school always have classes to support student's natural abilities and students, who love arts, are also free to enroll and find out their strength. Beside that, they also need to release stressful after two or three hours from studying. It's a good condition for students to recharge and heighten their energy for the next efficient block when they take the classes of art but it wastes time for students who won't spend time to practice it.

Today, studying in high school, which turns to boring with almost students because they can't locate where they are, what they are interested in at school. In that case, finding the funny things, which is the best way to counter that situation, is helping us to reduce stressful and recharge us from hold blocks study. For example, there are multiple choices for us like enrolling a band, joining a drama, taking part in an art class for making motivation in studying . We must be required to take those classes because that also is what we choose.

Beside that, choosing to sign up an art class are not only helping students to clean up their brain, which become easily to adopt information from the following block, but also increase efficient- adoption. For instance, after a serious block with full information in our brain, we must to clean it up by singing, acting or drawing class, it will help our brain feel relaxing and ready for adopting more information. It also depends on our type of favorite in entertainment that your body and brain can feeling relax when we are into it.

We agree that every students should be required to take those classes but if such classes won't be electives to select student's natural abilities; a huge students, who aren't serious about a music, a drama, an art class, will make other students feel uncomfortable. Like they are going to sleep or make noise which effect to everybody around to enjoy their fresh time.

To sum up, we know students should take a class from arts to make them feel fresh after a tired day or two to three blocks in a row to recharge and make our adoptive abilities improving; it help students produce motivation from school and make them feel comfortable without pressure. But classes of art still need to be electives to choose which students own availability to take part in that class to make sure they don't waste time in the block they even aren't interested in.

331103D7D5CF,"""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing, "" said by the philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer. Giving a good example by your own experience might influence other people; it depends on the situation. In my opinion, giving a good example is not the only thing to influence people as said in the quote, but there are things other than setting a good examples that influence people. For example, if someone had experience in playing basketball, and another guy was a beginner, it will be helpful if the experienced one helps him and shows him how to play by training him, but if the experienced one tells the begginner person an example of how to shoot the ball but not by showing him, it wouldn't be helpful to him and won't influence him.

One of the reasons i think that example might not be helpful is because when time moves on, the way that things work changes. Some people when they set a good example to influence someone that need motivation, they set an example from their own experience that might be some years ago, That can create a problem. For example, if a computer science major who graduated 10 years ago, and another one who just started college to study computer science and have some obstacles, if the major gave examples to the other guy about what he did in college 10 years ago to influence him, it would be a problem because as time goes we humans move forward in technology and we develop the education, so if the major gave the other guy his own experience it would be different than college now. This example won't help the guy who just started college, but it would be better if the major showed him the way to study and try to explain to him things.

Sometimes people understand examples wrongly and influence others in an incorrect way, and it can be a big problem, It can turn motivation into failure. For example, there was a famous quote saying that failing many times without loss of enthusiasm leads to success, if someone study medicine in college and then he found himself failing tests and projects, but he took this quote as his influencer and he didn't lose enthusiasm, maybe after a while when he find himself still getting the same grades, he will lose enthusiasm and he will give up. The problem here is that he misunderstood the quote, the quote meant that he shouldn't loss enthusiasm even if he fail many times, but he thought that after failing two or three times he will do more better.

Some people may argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the only and best way to influence other people, because they think that if people follow the examples of the experienced people, they will succeed and will be motivated to do more work. For example, if someone successful gave an example of how he became successful, and what obstacles did stop him, and how did he get through them, Maybe some teenager listen to him and become influenced, and then he work hard to become like the successful guy. Or maybe someone who failed in something listen to the successful guy and learn how did he get through the things that stopped him, and then he become motivated to be successful and he work hard to reach his goal.

In conclusion, influencing others by your own experience might be helpful to some people, but also it can become a problem and not helpful to alot of people. Furthermor, using examples from your own behavior is not the only way to influence others, thats why i disagree with the quote, because examples could be perfect, but it is not the best or the only way. There are other ways as i mentioned, that could turn people's lifes from failure to success."
B41ED2C0C016,"One place in the world I would like to visit is Generic_City,Peru. The reason I want to visit Peru is because my grandma and my dad live there, I haven't seen them in 7 years and I want to see them at least one more time until I grow up. Once I arrive I want to spend some time with my grandma and my dad to catch up what has happened over the years. I also want to go to the beach and the pool and go to the park with my whole family and have an awesome picnic and we would make smores and tell creepy stories, also I would want to get a tan,but one of the things i haven't done ever in my life is skydiving I know it would be really scary but it would also be really fun to see their reaction when the jump out of a plane it would be really funny to watch it over and over again. The last place I would visit is machu picchu because it is such a clam place. At night you see the stars and in the morning u see the sunset rising. I would never want to leave .To sum up i would have an amazing time with my family.

Because I would visit Peru I would see my cousins,brothers,grandma,aunts,uncle and my dad I would see them everyday and we would spend some family time together.

When I go to the beach we are going to have a picnic we are going to go swim also we are going to play some games we are going to have a blast !

I am going to visit machu picchu. The first thing i would do is watch the sunset, ride camels,ride horses and take awesome pictures."
77BB33DB5187,"The first impresions

The next text is about ""The firts impresions can change with the pass of time"". The object is give information to the reader about different things that make that the first impresions change, and how can affect. The text is made with examples and support ideas, that help to understand more the theme. Then tell that the impressions can change anytime.

The first impresions is when you current know at someone or something. It is the first opinion that you mind create, but this impresions or idea can change when you start to know better. When we current know a person, our mind create a idea that can be false or true, but is something that only can know with the time.

The change can affect or can benefit, that means that sometimes we thinks that is good and bad, thinks that is bad and is good. A example of affect is when we buy a car, and these is look like beautiful for autside, but when a mechanical check inside descover that have many damage. A example of benefit is when somebody told you something bad of other person, and when you talk with that person you descover that is false.

The first impresions can change for many reasons that our mind create; for example, false opinion, dissapointment, angry, or autocorrection. All these can have influence when you change your impresions of someone or something. For example, when we are angry all is look like bad or annoying. Other example, when we make a autocorrection of something that we believed that was bad or incorrect.

In my conclusion the firt impresions it's very important, no always going to be good or bad, your opinion going to change. I think when you don't know at someone or something is better wait a litte before make a bad or good idea about it. If for that I think that the firts impresions can change while passing the time."
7A25BCF70487,"Without failure you won't succeed in life. Failure is something you didn't succeed or accomplish yet failure does help you succeed in life. As a matter of fact, this could actually help you accomplish your goals.

I agree with Ralph Waldo statement because, you won't realize your mistakes. For example if you only succeed in life you won't know what to do if you fail or how to fix them. There for you'll achieve and have more success by failing. This helps because you'll actaully know the struggle people would put themself to accomplish their goal. Also knowing you have fail you'll know what is expected in order the success.

I disagree with Ralph Waldo statement because you won't accomplish as much goals. For example you won't know what to do if you ever do fail. i mean is good that your sucessing in life but just wait until the unexpected comes thats whe all the boom lets lose. i fact success isn't as bad is actually good.

In my opinion i would say success isn't as better as failure. They are both a team. While i agree this is why i pick Ralph statement is cause the un expected always comes in lfe.  "
579603CA894B,"Why is it important to learn from the experience of others? Well it could help you in the future to make a decision or to pick in between stuff.

I think it's really interesting to hear about other people back experiences. In overall if someone is trying to talk to you about their past experiences you should pay close attention because it could come handy in life.

One of the reasons why it's important to learn about other's past experiences is because it could help you out in the future. For example if you encounter the same situation as them you'll know what to do,in the other hand if you didn't pay attention to them and you face the same situation they did you'll be clueless on what to do. If a friend is in trouble or he needs advice with something you could help them out because of other's past experiences.

Another reason why it could be important to listen to someone's past experiences is so you don't make the same mistakes as them. When I was 8 years old my grandpa used to tell me that smoking wasn't good at all even tho he did it all the time,then my dad told me the same thing about smoking so I'll always know that smoking it's not good for anyone's health and I won't make the same mistake my grandpa did.

In conclusion I think that listening to other people's past experiences is good because it will help a lot in the future and it'll help you make important decisions in life and you could even help other people when they are struggling."
ACAE11A04F63,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree with this statement because it gives a perspective of how you are in your life, demonstrate how your personality is, and shows your live conditions.

It gives a perspective of how you are in your life because it shows the type of person you are, if you are irresponsible person or a bad person, and the manner of take the problems that came forward in your life. For example, if you have a job and you are constantly absent for work, it gives a bad impression because it demonstrate you are irresponsible, and the people can think bad things about you.

Demonstrate how your personality is because it shows how you can be with the people and demonstrate how you really are. For example, if you are honest and kindness with the people, they can trust you and have possitive thoughts about you.

Shows your live conditions because it demonstrate if you have personal cleanliness, if you care of your self etc. For example, if you go for a interview for apply in a job, and you not take a bath everyday, they would have a bad impression of you and maybe they not accept you in the job, and that led to the people bad comments about you.

Clearly, the prompt is correct because is how you shows how you are in your life, how is your personality, and your live conditions."
6CD1B8B6BEA8,"Should people make there own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? No people should not make there own decisions because sometime people need more opinions with thing they do. Like if they want to watch a move they can ask others on what to watch and they can help you out. Some people will say it's your life do what you want, make your own decisions but it is not that easy. I feel like sometime it's better to get guidance from other people, like my parents or older siblings because they are older and have been through some of the thing I have gone through. Sometimes things get hard in life and you are going to need help, we all as people need someone in life to help guide us through thing that may be bad. If you don't know what you want to be in life then you can think about things you like or get help from someone that you know that had that career. There is always going to be someone to go to for help even though people will say it's better to work by your self because you will not make any mistakes but we all make mistakes.

42BF43BF8DBE,"Why does the curfews are important in some cities and state for teenagers? The importance's of having curfews in the cities is that they will be out of trouble. Sometimes teenagers not follow the law especially on weekend. Having the curfew in the city will be more helpful for their life. Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law, and teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way.

Firstly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law. For instance, Generic_Name lives in Generic_City Virginia and he said that the law here is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be on streets or anywhere else. He always follow the law and keep him self out of trouble. If the city adopted the curfew after that the teenagers will start breaking the law after these hours. Therefore, every state and city should require curfew for teenagers.

Secondly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way. For example, My two friends went outside to have some fun and it was weekend. Saturday night there were out to get some ice-cream for them salve and family. The police stop them in their half way and asked them about what are they doing at this time outside;however, he said that you guys know that the curfew is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be outside. They lied to police that we were in hospital with our mom, and in our way we bought some ice-cream also. Thus, teenagers never put them salve in a trouble so having curfew is much better then not having it.

Some people argue that, having curfew in a city or state is wrong because they think its interfering in young people's lives. This point is true that curfew keeps teenagers from getting in a trouble. However, curfew can safe teenagers lives because in this age they don't know wrong and right they do what they like, and what they are interested. Curfew unfairly interfere in young people's lives because some teenagers have their own rules, and they don't listen to anyone. Lastly, cities should have curfew to safe teenagers lives and do not adopted the curfew.

In conclusion, the importance's of curfew is to have a better and safe life in your city. Teenagers have the ability to follow the law and get safe of trouble. Some teenagers does not put their self in trouble even if they lie they never get in trouble. Some people says that curfew is a force on young people's lives. Therefore, teenagers should be responsible, follow the law, and keep yourself out of trouble."
2D940E7F240C,"Do you think that schools should extend the school hours for 1 hour and 30 min? I agreee with this plan because it would help students education.

It can help students with their education:

The teachers would be able to explain more to the students so they can understand properly. Teachers can help educate the students by using the extra time to do more projects. The teachers can read more books with the class so they can be good readers and writers.

It would give students less days of school:

Students can get more relaxing time and come to school with a lot of energy. Students can get more time working on school work/homework at home during the weekend. Students wouldn't have to worry about going to school on the days that the school chooses to skip.

It can help students can get a lot smarter with extra hours:

The students can get extra time to do homework and trying to understand everything during the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes. The teachers can take the whole class to the library to check out or read books with the classroom. Students can have an extended gym time to get rid of all the energy inside them so they can learn and obtain all the information from the teachers.

I think that the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes would help students with education. It can really help the students because they get more time on their weekends and it gives them more time to study,work on homework, or finish a project. Should schools give more time for the teachers and students?"
5CAA840DD4C6,"AFTER SCHOOL HOMEWORK CLUB

Generic_Name

INTRODUCTION:

Havent you ever thought of starting an after school homework club for students who are having difficulty in certain subjects?.

BIGININ:Well in certain states school barely have extra help for students for Example in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and more states but in the united states is different they have extra programs the main thing is us the students they want a good education in my Generic_School we have an after school it's call Hornet 21 and in my opinion i think that having a program like that is awesome why you might be asking well here are some few reasons 1st of all you get to see on what the students need help 2nd of all you get to ask them on what they get stuck or don't understand. 3rd of all you get to meet you'r teacher and they get to meet you. there some students that are to shy to talk about it this will also help the teachers on where or what group they should them to work on what do they need work on? witch would be very helpful them and there teachers and the teachers might notices some changes or not. not every mistake can be change but you can start fresh again.

FIRST: it would also be helpful to see on what subject there really good and they are confident about it those teachers who help on everything like they know everything they move from one to another class room they could help those kind of students that get homework from different subjects for example like Math,Scients, Social studies. and the teachers could inform the students teacher on what there struggling and on what there all good on I mean you never know if those student's could be are next president or are next doctor, police.

this program is also nice because it helps students practice English not for all of them but for some of them yes this help me a lot.

MIDDLE: this program will also make the student proud of them self a little thing can change our world to be come better our country need programs like this programs that are going to success us programs that were going to be proud of this kind of programs have help a lot of students i know sens elementary school and not should middle school have it high school and elementary to and is also nice because some parents come late to work and the program would be finishing about 4:50 so there going to be fine when they get home so they can be home alone this after school activity would also get them prepare for there exams they could study and they would easy get an A or a B. END You could also do this to a student who doesn't want to do there work or nothing you can make them stay in after school and they can finish what they decided to not do and that might be a big lesson for them to learn you could also tell some of the students to spread the word to some of there friends so you could get more students everyday and if they stay Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday on Thursday and Friday they could have a free day you could have them do soccer basketball anything they want if they deserved it, you could also announced one day so the whole school would know about the program this could also be fun for the teachers not just for the students teachers to well that's what i think on a after school homework club. Base on this information I can say that schools do need this program Because it's really helpful for the student's. outside in the worlds there some kids who don't even know what school is because there working to feed there family. The community should do more programs like this so students get extra help. not all the county gets to have fun activities like us. and my opinion is yes it's good to have after school programs for schools and kids who care and that have a featured."

Others believe that it instigates procrastination. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up and it allows us time for new ideas.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up. For example, I was once taking a very long test that lasted around 4 to 5 hours. At first, I was just guessing my way through it because I was very tired and ready to give up. Then, we were given a five minute break so I got up and walked around a bit. After walking for a few minutes, I was energized and ready to finish the test. With my new found energy, I was very content with the test and my score. In fact, students who take mental breaks during long testing periods score 31% higher than the ones who did not take any breaks. In conclusion, inactivity keeps us enthusiastic about our work.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it allows us time for new ideas. For example, one of my friends named Generic_Name once did not go to school for three days. During these three days, she organized her school essentials and cleaned up her room. Since she was working on a project before the break, she had time to finish it and she even had another project idea for her science class. She obtained a good grade on both projects. In fact, students who have taken breaks during long tests, like the SOL, say that after their break they had a better understanding of the test. Even the workforce workers are encouraged to take a few days off. It helps the worker get more creative. Even the owner of a business need a vacation. In fact, around 56% of entrepreneurs say that they came up with at least one new idea after a vacation. Inactivity helps prepare our minds for when we are active.

Inactivity serves a purpose. Inactivity keeps us from throwing in the towel. it gives us a mental break; which, creates time for new ideas. Some believe that inactivity encourages laziness. However, it gives us time to rejuvenate our attitude and our mindset. If we take more breaks, to let our mind wonder, we would be more effective in anything it is we are doing. "
50419253BA19,"Should take classes like music,a drama,or an art class be required? Although some say that arts class should not be required,actually it should because students can develop talents and also it can help students to lost some stress. In addition, students will find a fun way to be less stress. I am agree with the assertion that student should be required to take an arts class.

Those who believe that arts class shouldn't be required they have their reasons. For example they believe that students may not like the class assigned and they also think that it can cause that a student may start cutting his classes.

From my perspective I believe that arts class should be required to students because they can develop talents. I believe that because when I was in my country there was one private high school that was located at my city,in that high school all students were required to take an arts class and nevertheless some of them knew how to pain,act,and sing and they were so talented in any arts class that they were taking. Also in my country every year there is a competition that call the most talented students from the country, this competition only awards students that are very talented in arts class such as pain,act,and sing an the students that just to go to the high school that was in my city they frequently just to take first place in those competitions and that's why I believe that that arts class should be required for students it will help develop talents.

From my point of view, I think that arts class should be required because it can help students to lose some stress. I believe it because like a student that I am every time when I get off from my Algebra 2 class I am always super stress,but after that class I have the art class. In that class I always lost all my stress when I start drawing things even though I do not how to draw but it help me a lot to keep my main clam. Also why I believe that arts class help students to be less stress is because the environment in the class is always nice,and the students are always focus in the things that they are doing without making to much noise and that is why I believe that arts class should be required to help them to don't be stress the all day in school .

To summarize students should be required to take arts class because they can learn to do other things that other people can't do and also it can help them like a way to feel better after coming from other class that was awful."
AB7823891008,"I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age.

My first response is some children can commit to a career at a young age, if they want to improve and they want a good future, they have to go to school and many of children can helped from their parents.

For example; if someone want a career at young age they have to work hard, and pay attention, some time is going to be difficult for them but they can do it.

Children engage in a career at a young age to prepare themselves for their future .

Also, is a good idea for students to a career at a young age because they are improve in a good age and they thinking about their future, but in a career at young age some children want to graduated at a young age, first they have to work hard at school, and there are many way, and programs to be graduated from Hig School for a career at a young age.

In conclusion, kids who take advantage of programs, and High Schools, are qualifying these students for their lives ahead in order to have a good future with a career they want. I definitely think that programs make a positive input in these helping young life.

D35A126B4379,"Anyone can have a talent or skill, you just need to see what it is. They can help along the way to get you something really helpful, for example collage. Your talent can be playing an instrument, singing, or dancing. A skill can be building things, sports, and cooking. The talent I have is playing a Guitar because it took time, practice, and studying.

When you want to do something big it can take a lot of time. Time is what we all need and time can go fast or slow, but thats good because it can really be helpful. Playing the Guitar took a while but it payed off, mostly because I used my free time to play. Sometimes I can get stress playing mainly by not having much time playing before a concert. It could be hard doing it ,but by doing so I can see my self getting better each day.

Practicing could get hard, but if your relax and not think too much you'll see it will be easy. Practicing can make you accomplish anything you've been doing a long time. Doing the Guitar was hard but not too hard because I've been practicing for a while. Playing some of the songs were fast and long, but when I got home I'd play the song over and over until I got it just right. Thats how I know by practicing is really helpful and made me be good at doing the I wanted to do the most in life.

Some people don't like to study and its not something we have to do, but something we need to do. I think studying is more of a thing you want to do if you care so much about what your doing. Studying the notes was one of the first things I had to do before playing the Guitar and the songs. By studying I can see the notes were not that easy to play and also tuning the Guitar, but thats why I studied to see what I was doing wrong. Studying is what I did to be fantastic at the Guitar also being amazing at the concerts.

In conclusion, If you want to be awesome at what your doing you need to use your time wisely, practice, and study. By doing all that you'll see that you will be amazed at what you did. Maybe you can even be famous for what you did by focusing on your goal. To sum this all up just do at what you do best in life maybe it can pay off real good.``"
327AAC23CF5D,"On my Opinion i think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online or on video chat is a good way to do it, because some students sometimes some of then they live so far of the school so they dont have other way to educate they self and i think is a good communication to learn.

Is a good benefit because is a easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not trasportate to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school.

If i have to take classes on online or video chat i will because more easy for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat. And because i can have more free time i can do more things and i can have a job.

And think too for some student is not good because they dont have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they dont have internet is difficult for them. Is a good option online classes but not for all students some of them are benefit and some of them dot.

Only classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to cominitate in a long distance, but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they dont have to pay nothing.

The time if they take online classes they they go not miss nothing because they can star when they want.

On my oponion is a goog way to do it.     "
72C0B0B91BFC,"There are so many things that can make good deed too someone with a good attitude even you can make yourself happy, But sometimes its hard to keep a good attitude while its a difficult time. I myself have witnessed someone with a good attitude it was my good old friend he was having a good attitude all day,But than someone in his family passed away he was really sad about it. Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she can't leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family.

I have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying ""I got nobody I got nobody"" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on.

When you have a good attitude it can make your day be good and you'll be positive with everything. Even in a bad times like for example if a family member or a friend is sick you can make there day by getting them there favorite food or snack that can get them in a good attitude with you because they may be a little grumpy while there sick.

While your in a good attitude you'll feel like you accomplish something for today and while other people will try to take you down you mind and your feeling will be strong and you won't be able to be in a bad attitude. Most people would want to be be in a good attitude but others are the world should just be happy and not always mad at something. I wish everyone in the world can be happy and something they did and not be mad at everything like sometimes when you play sports when you lose its a little upsetting at first but than you lose your attitude get stronger and you start being your self way more.

I witnessed another of my friends trying to keep a good attitude his attitude was getting stronger and better because he played a lot of soccer but than his dad kept taking it to seriously. My friend was so tired that he wanted to take a break but his dad didnt let him he kept telling him get up lets go play everyday and on weekend his dad woke him up at 5 in the morning to go play soccer. Than on Monday when he got back to school he started getting eye bags under his eyes and than he was tired of it and went o his dad and i said '' Im tired of soccer and i give up''. His dad looked so shocked and upset that he left him speechless and than he said fine when you grow up you are not going to become a famous soccer player. My friend still played soccer but he only played when he wanted to and he still was really good at soccer that I bet you he is better than me.

One time my friend and I were in a good attitude right we were playing at the park and than my friend jumped off the slid and than he broke his arm is was so nasty His bone was popping out he was crying and yelling and Ididnt know what to do and i called his partents they came so fast and than they took him to the hospetil and I was sad because I felt like it was all my fault and than his partents cheered me up and they said ''its not yout fault its okay its just a common mistake and a few weeks later his arm got better his arm was in a case so he was good and I was the first one that sighned it so i was happy about that and than we were both happy we got ice cream and we had a sleepover and the rest of the day was good."
BC1F1C37721E,"Is it possible to impress someone at first time? Based on my experience I am extremely agree with this statement. It's possible to impress someone based on what we are, what we are doing, and what we want from them to do, because now days which everyone is fully educated and knows what is wrong or right, believes on their own. We can impress people towards our religion, towards our government party, and towards out country to visit.

We can impress people towards our religion by giving them the ideas of what is it about. How it will change up your future, how it will impact on your kids, how to treat with others, and also the idea of understanding someone better. Take them with us to the place where we practice our own religion, tell them the truth and advantages of it, and also show the religious cultures.

We could impress people towards our government parties to support us by voting us. Promise them that we would not let them down, we will accept their wants and help them to advice it, we will make their education department strong that everyone can get education, and we will make sure that we provide them their dream jobs after they graduate college.

We might impress someone to visit our country by telling them about the situation of our country, and tell them how cheap the things are. Show them the beautiful places, historical temples, culture, different kinds of foods, clothing, also about the rights of people.

To conclude, impression is something that people do for others to get their attention for a specific thing, such as impressing people to convert to their religion, motivating people to vote for a specific government and choose a good leader for their country, and also impressing people towards their countries situation to persuade them to visit their country. "
F6B1E10F02C8,"The first impression does't mean that you are like your look, or because your look angry you are a bad person.

One day in the morning my dad show me a picture of my grandfather, he was a tall and stronger men, more later my dad come to my room and he tell me ""We are going to know you grandfather"", i was scared but , when i see hem, he was adorable and so loving with me, when a know my grandfather more, i change my opinion of the first impression, he was not a rude men.

When i see for the first time a girl that i never seem, the first that i see is how the girl look if she look angry, i think is that she is disagreeable, but in the future, when i know more about that girl i know that she is not how i was thinking in the first impressions, is not good to judge people for how they act, it does't care the color of the eye, the color of the skin or what language they speak. Some people look bad, sad, happy, angry, or evil but that's not mean that they are like they look.

In conclusion the first impression it's possible to change, because the people can not act how you think they act or they can change the attitude in the future, when i know more about this person my opinion of the first impression change."
6B8C02811FF6,"Yes i agree for that all we have that be our selves for put to go out a head we live in the own world where the people judges our behavior and not sees its errors. because in this world to be bieng you yourself and don't matter how you are, you have that yourself, always we need remmerber that you can change the world, not the world change you.

all of them we have a problem but we need learn, follow our dreams i want graduate this year sometimes i think i can't anymore but i have a son i need to follow because he follow me i want change the world for my son he need make a better person because he need help other people i want that he follow her dreams.

1DB195AA7BE3,"Well the best option for my is what you attend the classes from home by way of online .

My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn, in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take, classes like after school just in home . So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours, and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas .

Examples:

If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online.

If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class.

With this examples are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home .

If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time .

Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it 's not easy .

I think whent a teacher said you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and my opinion or my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing.

One reason because im take that option is because in my home is relax, and with food and alone and not voices and nothing, and in my home take my time for think most better i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . One reason for what i take this option is for the time ya what much student are major or not have much time for coming a school because the work or others case. Other reasons what the student take this option is beacuse is home not in other pleace ya what not has ride or cars for take that class or classes en other pleace .

My intentions is what others student take this option what is classes from HOME because is the best ,option for any case too if you want free time is more easy for you take this class or classes home by way of online, and is more choice that idea and minus dificult just what in home or online you not have teacher for explain any question so for that reason is little complicate but not impossible make you work so you cant do it , forever you want , nothing is this life is impossible but too not is easy everthing is sacrifice. Abd you has see you work good and past the class sin difucult .

My reference is the option class

FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE. Is the best option and more benefif for learn in home, and more easy for the time or others problem and i cant wait what everthing stay good for my cass or classes .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        "
D8532CCFE454,"Yes I identify with churchill and his statement that for us to reach what we want, we have to pass for a lot of things.

For us to be able to achieve our goal, it doesnt matter if our goal is a short goal or a long goal, first of all we have to pass some difficulties to be able to reach the goal that we want. If we want to see the results of success in our life we never have to loss the enthusiasm on it to be where we want it to be.

To reach the porpose that we want is something fantastic because only the person that fight for them know what they have had to pass to reach the goal. How can we be a support for does people that need help to reach their achievements, but for our on self is difficult to give us a impulse to reach our own goals. The things in this life are hard nothing is easy, but not impossible. What can we do for us, so we can always have the the enthusiasm high, so we can have the decisition to tell our self we got this. Sometimes there have to be a person to give us a shove to undestand that we got it. In my opinion and I say this because this happen to me all the time, I give out advice , I help those people that dont believe on there selfs no more, give them a word to push them to keep goinginto the get it and tell themnever put there self down.

Every single one that have complete a goal have had to pass on problems, that you have problemts doesnt mean that you are on the way to give up, to throw everything you have done at this point. Those problems, those failure you have had are helping you to bild your character, to change the way you see life to see the things with other prespective. I never heard someone saying that reaching something is easy, fast or simple. To be successful is something hard, its a huge feeling to get your own respect that you can do it. Being successful is something difficult to overcome, the reward is amazing. It is a nice thing to see everything whta we had go over to get where you at is just for the effort that you put on it. Is a bless to go forward in life tellingpeople how to do, what to do so they can get a advice from you to be a successful person, to try very hard to achieve their goals.

In conclusion to be a winner require to pass all difficulties that life give out. Those failure are horrible but at the end of the day of the day you will understand why did it happen. Whene you get along very well you would say now I understand how to haddle out this problems. Like i said before to achieve something is like get out of the something and enter to other failure. when the years pass out you will have create anew version of your character, personality that you construct, this new person will have the capacity to make the hard esay. In my opinion I believe that getting or achieving our goals consist on a route of failure, problems, difficulties, ect. The things that are up on the hill those that are hard to reach are the great ones, the right ones. "
52B24BAEDC8C,dear TEACHER_NAME i think the you should let students use their cell phones during free times like lunch time and in class when their teacher give them free time in class or during the morning because i think it's not fair because only teacher can use their phones and not us because what if we get an emergency call like the teacher and we have to go home because that's what the teachers do when they get and emergency call they get sub and go home what if something like that happens to us what if someone has and a emergency like get hurt in p-e time or something else because that's why we get phones for an emergency so that's why i believe is better to let student's use their cell phones on free time or lunch time or an emergency call because something might happen on time or they want to talk to their friends on my space or internet to talk to their cousins or family or want to call their family to know what are they doing or if they are ok or if they need enything or if their parents are going to pick them up after school or have an appointment with the doctor and i think their phones need to turn off when they need to when the teacher tells them to turn them off because other students are going to get distracted and might not pay attention on what there doing and they are not are going to do
0F19DD8FEEDC,"Dear, principal,

i will like to star in saying that i think it would be good for us student to help the environment because that way there is not to much contamination on the community and it would be healthy and safe to the people that lives in the community. Us student can also do good thinks when we are doing the community service because that way un winter we can go and shovel some snow and on summer we could do other things. and doing community service its not only going outside or doing hard work you can also help some church , hospitals ,in a store and also in helping teachers and other things like babysitting. Doing community service it could also be fun it doesn't have to always be boring it could be fun because if they send you to places that you have to be with a lot of people you could be with your friend when you are doing community service like helping a teacher the teacher might need to helpers so you can ask your friend if he/she wants to go with you so you could not be by your self. community service it is also good because the way you are not always in your house trying to figure out what are you going to do because your bored or you will not be just laying down in the bed or in the sofa playing video games or watching a movie because over time that will get boring for you and it will affect your healthy so that's why its good to do community service even ones a week or in a month its not bad to do community service I do community service all Sundays and sometimes over the weekend it is so fun to do community service because i spend some times with my friends with out going to the mall or anything like that so it will be good for other student to do some community services so they can see that it is not boring to do them. so i will like to tell you principal that you should put students to do community services so they could see how good and fun it is . i will like to say that is fun to do because sometimes you are like what should i do today or what i am going to do tomorrow and you get so stress that you don't even know what to do so sometimes when you are like that and you have to do community service it would not be that hard for you to stress. you can also help your mom doing something it would be good for her to you be helping here to your dad to because sometimes your dad its tired of working and he will ask your help so you could help him and that will also can be community service because your helping your parents so that's why i thing you should put student to do the community service.

Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart.

The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues.

Curfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning. If you are not healthy it will effect your studies. A person health should be a first priority. Most teenagers are not mature enough curfew will keep them healthy. There was a day when I was out with my friends on shopping. We went to mall together. I went back at home at 12:30 pm, than in morning I went to school. I did the same routine for a week. After that I started getting sick. It effected my brain. I went to doctor they said it happened because of lack of sleep. After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger. The more you will get good sleep the better your health will be.

Curfew will keep teenagers smart. Most of teenagers like to study at night unless they get distracted by extra stuff. Teenagers go school in the morning some of them do extracurricular activities. They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They don't do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had ""D"" in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent.

There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.                                                                                          "

If they have two or more day off they would try to do somenting else.

All people need to have time for care about the family and be responsable for their child.

If we have more time with our parents so we can expend more time on our school.

Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours.

I desagree because if we have two more hours we can not have hours for study and make the thing that we want."

Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for education purpose. Many people say cellphones is a great tool for specific things, such as something you may want to know or something you do not know. In my opinion cell phones should not be allow to used it the classroom because students use cellphones all day and do no pay attention, cellphones it can be used for other things, and cellphones distract you.

The students use the cellphones all day and do not pay any attention during class is really bad for students because, they come to school to learn and not be in their cellphones. For example, cellphones it may help you to look for something you might want to know, but when the test and quizzes comes students are not going to know anything because students did not pay attention for being in their cellphones the hall day doing nothing.

Cellphone it can be used for other things, for text with friends or, play games during classes, for watch videos during class, listen to music and not listening on what the teacher is saying. Also students use cellphones to take videos, or photos that they want to search in their social media or just for have fun. For example some students likes to take photos of someone just for have fun or just for bully them in their social media.

Some people say cellphones is a tool to do homework, project, or something you want to do in your cellphone, or when you are confused with something, however cellphones distract you to do those kind of stuff, such as being at your apps and not doing what you suppose to be doing while because you are texting or face timing someone and you get distract and you forgot about to finish your homework or classwork that the teacher have signed you to do,and your grades might go down into a zero if your keep distracting yourself being in you phone during class time.

In conclusion some schools use cell phones in their classroom for educational purpose. Cellphones should not be allow during classroom for educational purposes because students would not learn anything if they are in theirs cellphones during classroom , we know that every student love being in their cellphone during the day, but cellphones will not help student in their educational purposes, and cellphones are not gonna help you learn what you need to learn during students school education.
