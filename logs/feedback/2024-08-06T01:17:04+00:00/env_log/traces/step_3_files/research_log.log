Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To start the research, the first step is to understand the data and the machine learning task by examining the data description file.

[Action]: The action was to "Understand File" with the input of examining the "data_description.txt" file to find information about the dataset, including its structure, features, target variable, and any specific details about the machine learning task.

[Observation]: The observation summarizes the key information from the data description file, including that the dataset is the ELLIPSE corpus of argumentative essays written by English Language Learners, the essays have been scored on six analytic measures, and the task is to predict the scores for the six measures on the test set.
