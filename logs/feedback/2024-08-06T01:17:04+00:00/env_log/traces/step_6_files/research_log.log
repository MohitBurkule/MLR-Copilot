Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To start the research, the first step is to understand the data and the machine learning task by examining the data description file.

[Action]: The action was to "Understand File" with the input of examining the "data_description.txt" file to find information about the dataset, including its structure, features, target variable, and any specific details about the machine learning task.

[Observation]: The observation summarizes the key information from the data description file, including that the dataset is the ELLIPSE corpus of argumentative essays written by English Language Learners, the essays have been scored on six analytic measures, and the task is to predict the scores for the six measures on the test set. The observation also notes that the specific details about the machine learning task, such as the type of model to be used or the evaluation metric, were not found in the data description file.

[Feedback]: The human feedback is to "continue", indicating that the action and observation were appropriate, and the research should proceed to the next step.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The previous observation provided valuable information about the ELLIPSE corpus and the machine learning task, but there were still some remaining details to understand, particularly around the evaluation metric and submission format. Reviewing the "evaluation_details.txt" file was the next logical step to ensure a complete understanding of the assessment criteria and requirements for the final submission.

[Action]: The action was to understand the contents of the "evaluation_details.txt" file, specifically looking for information about the evaluation metric, submission format, and any other relevant details for model assessment and submission.

[Observation]: The key information found in the "evaluation_details.txt" file includes:
1. Evaluation Metric: The submissions are scored using MCRMSE (mean columnwise root mean squared error), as defined in the provided formula.
2. Submission Format: The submission file should have a header and the following format: text_id,cohesion,syntax,vocabulary,phraseology,grammar,conventions.
3. Other Relevant Details: The test set contains text_id values, and for each text_id, the model should predict values for the six analytic measures (cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions).

[Feedback]: The human feedback is to continue.
